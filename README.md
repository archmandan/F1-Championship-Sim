A console-based F1 Championship Simulator built in Python. This project simulates a full Formula 1 season, taking into account **Driver skill**, **Team performance**, and **Track difficulty** to determine race results.  

---

## Features

- Simulates a full F1 season with multiple races.
- Takes driver skill, team performance, and track difficulty into account.
- Stores race and season data in an SQLite database.
- Adjustable track difficulties (based on EA F1 25 player AI ratings).
- Generates race results and championship standings.
- Easy to extend with new tracks, drivers, or custom rules.

I can also make a **slimmer “GitHub-ready” version with badges, screenshots, and a simple “quick start” section** if you want it to look more polished online.  

Do you want me to do that version too?
